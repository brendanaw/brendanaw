  Welcome to my repo!

<h2>Hey, I'm Brendan</h2>

I'm a Singaporean writer, GTM engineer, and AI entrepreneur featured and referenced in Entrepreneur, Buffer, Hackernoon, and other popular publications.

I also enjoy building automation workflows using no-code and low-code tools like Zapier, Make, n8n, and LLMs (GPT, Claude), glued seamlessly with various software tools and APIs.

Professionally, I've spent nearly a decade in managerial marketing positions across diverse 7 to 8-figure high-growth SMEs spanning e-commerce, Web3, agency services, finance, retail, and e-sports sectors. These experiences came with unique challenges and learnings, which I like to share with my audience.

These days, you'll find me working abroad while simultaneously building my online entrepreneurship journey and exploring exciting side projectsâ€”one of which is my automation agency, <a href="https://nimbflow.com">Nimbflow</a>.

My work is a constant experiment in leveraging technology, creativity, and strategic thinking to push the boundaries of digital business.
